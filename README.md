Navigation: The Navigation component creates a navigation bar that allows users to easily navigate between different sections of the website. It includes links to various pages such as Home, Products Showcase, Sales Insights, etc.

Footer: The Footer component is displayed at the bottom of every page and contains information such as contact details, quick links, and copyright information.

Trends: The Trends component fetches trending topics using the News API and presents them to users. It allows users to stay updated with the latest trends in various industries.

## Technologies Used
React: We use React.js, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create dynamic and interactive components for our frontend.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for styling the components and ensuring a visually appealing layout.

React Router: React Router is used for declarative routing in our single-page application, enabling navigation between different views/components without a full page reload.

REST API: We interact with RESTful APIs to fetch and manipulate data from the backend server.

PropTypes: PropTypes is used for typechecking to ensure that components receive the correct props.

TypeScript: TypeScript is used exclusively to build the Task Manager component, providing static typing and improved developer experience.
